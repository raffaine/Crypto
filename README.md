Crypto
======

Simple UI for applying cryptography over plain text ... comes with a set of crypto algorithms

Crypto is not a big project, is not intended to be a big project ... it's a fun project. A friend of mine proposed a chalenge: What is writen in the lines above. The first one was very simple, and is the first supported here.

Cypher Algorithms
=================

Actually I don't know much on the subject, but here are some supported algorithms:
 - Caesar Cypher with char shift: Very simple one, where we only shift the letter value on the ASCII table.
 - Random Crazy Caesar: This one is only an idea, have not implemented it. It envolves random shifts ... the only thing we know ... the seed of the random number generator.
